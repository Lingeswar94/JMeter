Samplers in JMeter are added as a child of Thread Groups. These are used to send different types of requests to the server.

Once, the sampler request is processed by the server, its response is returned to JMeter and the same can be viewed and analyzed in terms of different performance parameters like response time, Hits per second, throughput, etc.

Types of Samplers :

HTTP Request
JDBC Request
XML/SOAP RPC Request
Test Action
FTP Request
